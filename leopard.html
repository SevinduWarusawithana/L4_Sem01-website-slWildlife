                <h4>Threat 1: Habitat Loss</h4>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Habitat loss is a significant threat to leopard populations, leading to a decline in their natural environments. This has consequences for their prey availability and overall ecosystem balance.</p>
            <p>Conservation efforts include habitat restoration projects and the establishment of protected areas.</p>

                <h4>Threat 2: Poaching</h4>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Poaching poses a serious threat to leopards, driven by illegal wildlife trade and demand for leopard parts. This activity has severe consequences for leopard populations and disrupts the natural balance of ecosystems.</p>
            <p>Conservation measures involve anti-poaching patrols, community education, and supporting laws against wildlife trafficking.</p>
